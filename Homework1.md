# Homework 1

A. Suppose that you determine the masses of 100 objects by weighing the first, then weighing the first and second together, and then weighing the rest in triplets: the first, second, and third; the second, third, and fourth; and so forth. (A) Identify the data and model
parameters in this problem. How many of each are there? (B) Write down the matrix **G** in the equation  **d** = **G** **m** that relates the data to the model parameters. (C) How sparse is **G**? How many element does it have and how many are zero? Give the percentage.

B. Let the data **d** be the running average of the model parameters, **m**, computed by averaging
groups of three neighboring points; that is, `d_i= (m_i + m_i + m_i+1)/3. (A) What is the
matrix G in the equation dÂ¼ Gm in this case? (B) What problems arise at the top and
bottom rows of the matrix and how can you deal with them? (C) How sparse is G?
What percent of it is zero?
