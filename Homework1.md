# Homework 1

A. Suppose that you determine the masses of 100 objects by weighing the first, then weighing the first and second together, and then weighing the rest in triplets: the first, second, and third; the second, third, and fourth; and so forth. (A) Identify the data and model
parameters in this problem. How many of each are there? (B) Write down the matrix **G** in the equation  **d** = **G** **m** that relates the data to the model parameters. (C) How sparse is **G**? How many element does it have and how many are zero? Give the percentage.
